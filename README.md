# Hi Everyone ! This is Haaris

I'd pay to be in the war room during the peak time in any SRE room dealing with peak traffic. I've always aspired to be an SRE because doing stuff that has a large impact , that gives me a kick.

I've always been keen on automating stuff and troubleshooting. After my introduction to the Cloud in my Undergrad , I've been  learning the nuances of working in the cloud.

The tools and technologies I've been able to learn so far are :

 - Programming : Javascript 
 - Scripting : Bash , Python
 - Containerization : Docker
 - Orchestration : Kubernetes
 - Infrastructure as Code : Terraform 
 - Cloud : AWS , GCP
 - CICD : GitLab
 - Observability : Prometheus 
 
 **Personal Projects I've been working on :**
 
 - Automation of Provisioning of Hyperledger Fabric Network
